# Work-Day-Planner

!(https://kblack4290.github.io/Work-Day-Planner/)

Here is a work day scheduler to help keep the user organized throughout the day. 

The current date wil display above the text area and will change each day to the current day. 

The user will know if the hour is past present or future by the textarea being color coded. If it is past time then the color will be grey, if it is current then the color is red, and if the time is in the future the color will be green. 

The user can submit tasks in the hour block and save. The user can close the planner and go back to it later and still see their previous tasks displayed in the hour block. 

This application will help the user become more organized and stay on top of their tasks.
